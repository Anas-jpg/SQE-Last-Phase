# SQE-Last-Phase

The last phase of the project which consists of some non functional requirements based on our future project named **"Snack Time-Any Time"**.
The GPS-based mobile app **"Snack Time-Any Time"** assists users in locating the closest restaurants based on their current location and other factors like pricing, restaurant type, food, and much more. Plus, restaurant owners can provide their restaurant information and the user's search results will be based on this data.
